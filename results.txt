**Calculus 1: Derivatives**

**Introduction:**

* Definition of a derivative as the instantaneous rate of change of a function.
* Geometric interpretation of the derivative as the slope of a tangent line.

**Techniques for Finding Derivatives:**

* Limit definition of the derivative
* Power rule
* Product rule
* Quotient rule
* Chain rule

**Applications of Derivatives:**

* Finding local extrema (maximums and minimums)
* Optimization problems
* Related rates problems
* Curve sketching (identifying critical points, concavity, and points of inflection)

**Additional Concepts:**

* Rolle's Theorem: If a function is continuous on a closed interval and differentiable on the open interval, then it has at least one zero on the interval.
* Mean Value Theorem: If a function is continuous on a closed interval and differentiable on the open interval, then there exists a number c in the interval such that the instantaneous rate of change at c is equal to the average rate of change over the interval.

**Higher Derivatives and Applications:**

* Second derivative: Used to determine concavity and inflection points.
* Third derivative and beyond: Useful in higher-level applications.

**Advanced Topics:**

* Implicit differentiation: Finding the derivative of a function defined implicitly.
* Parametrized curves: Finding the velocity and acceleration of a curve.
* L'Hopital's Rule: Used to evaluate limits of indeterminate forms.
